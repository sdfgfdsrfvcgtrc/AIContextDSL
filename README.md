# ContextML — Developed by a Non-professional Programmer

This is a personal attempt to enhance communication with AI chats, making it more productive and efficient.

The primary focus lies on maintaining the context of conversations from their very beginning through ongoing interactions.

It goes beyond programming — it's fundamentally about preserving the relevance of context when interacting with AI systems in general.

While aiming for significant improvements might seem ambitious, I'm taking small but practical steps toward achieving even modest gains (starting with just a 10% improvement, then another 10%, and so forth).

Most parts of this project were created with the assistance of AI.

## The Story Behind It

One evening, I set myself the task of generating two hundred professional articles for a friend. To speed things up, I opened three AI chat windows simultaneously. It looked like something straight out of a hacker movie, with screens overflowing with flashing symbols. However, manually copying and pasting quickly became exhausting.

So I decided to automate the process. I built a simple program—a browser extension plus converter and storage module—allowing me to handle multiple chat sessions efficiently. With one click, topics would be sent, texts converted into desired formats, and uploaded automatically.

Everything worked smoothly until prompt number five. Curiously enough, the exact same prompts were running concurrently across five different leading online chat platforms. Then came the surprises...

For now, the program remains unpublished because it's still raw and imperfect. That's typical when working with AI-generated content—it always comes with quirks. Hence, I've made this repository public, hoping to find collaborators who can help solve some of these challenges together.

Aside from that, there's also a subtle message for developers of AI models and programmers alike: most marketing slogans promise instant solutions ("let us write code while you relax"), but isn't coding itself part of the fun?

Now let's dive deeper into the key problems I encountered during the creation of this language.

## Challenges Faced While Developing the Language

When testing contextual data transfer, several recurring issues emerged:

1. **File Correction**: Fix one file, and suddenly the AI suggests modifying others, which often breaks functionality elsewhere.

2. **Library Versions**: Library updates cause inconsistency between installed packages and outdated documentation used by the AI. Searching online helps, but after a few iterations, context gets lost, complicating the workflow.

3. **Additional Dependencies**: Sometimes the AI recommends installing extra libraries incompatible with existing configurations.

4. **File Paths**: The AI forgets paths to project files, especially when importing external modules. After ten smooth queries, it suddenly imports libraries from outer space.

5. **Constant Improvements**: No matter how many times you ask, the AI keeps refining the code, introducing additional tweaks. By the tenth iteration, figuring out what's happening becomes nearly impossible.

To sum it up succinctly: imagine solving 2 × 2. Instead of simply calculating four, the AI performs elaborate calculations involving multiplications, subtractions, and rounding. It's correct, sure, but understanding the underlying logic is non-trivial, particularly for complex tasks.
