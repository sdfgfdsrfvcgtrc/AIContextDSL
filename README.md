# ContextML
## Context Binding Language for AI systems

**ContextML** is a YAML-compatible markup language for passing structured context between developers and AI tools. The files use the `.ctml' extension.

## Project Master File (project.ctml):
* Contains a map of all entities (files, libraries, modules, tasks, documents)
* Captures the relationships between the elements

## Annotations in context:
* Embeds labels in source code files
* Binds annotations to specific entities

## Practical application:
* Persistent context for chatting with AI tools
* Automatic documentation of relationships in code
* Tracking architectural decisions

## Rules for modifying the specification
Modifications to the official specification are possible exclusively by the project owner. Community members can propose changes and improvements to the project implementation through the pull-request submission procedure.

## Conclusion
The ContextML project is available to a wide range of developers and researchers. The author welcomes feedback and invites interested parties to discuss further evolution of the project. The author can be contacted by e-mail: zhelannikov.n.a@gmail.com.
